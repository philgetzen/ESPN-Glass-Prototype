# ESPN Liquid Glass Prototype

> **üöß Work in Progress** - This is an experimental prototype showcasing iOS 26's Liquid Glass APIs  
> **iOS 26 Native Glass Effects in Beta** ‚ú®

A reimagined ESPN app prototype demonstrating iOS 26's native Liquid Glass APIs with real ESPN content integration. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for next-generation glass morphing effects, advanced SwiftUI patterns, and modern sports content consumption.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode-beta** (17.0+ with iOS 26 SDK support)
- **iOS 26.0+** device or simulator
- **iPhone 16 Pro** or newer (recommended for optimal glass effects)

### Build & Run
```bash
# Open project
open ESPNLiquidGlass.xcodeproj

# Or build from command line with iOS 26 SDK
/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild \
    -project ESPNLiquidGlass.xcodeproj \
    -scheme ESPNLiquidGlass \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' \
    -sdk iphonesimulator26.0 \
    build
```

## ‚ú® Highlights

### üèà Real ESPN Content Integration
- **Live Scores** - Real-time sports scores and updates with live status indicators
- **News Feed** - ESPN articles with clips support (full article deeplinks to ESPN app)
- **Video Streaming** - ESPN Watch integration with authentication handling (clips play back, authed content goes to ESPN app)
- **Multiple Sports** - NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAA, and international leagues
- **Smart Content Parsing** - Automatic categorization and metadata extraction
- **Deep Linking** - ESPN app integration for premium content access

### üì± Modern SwiftUI Architecture
- **SwiftUI 6.0** - Latest declarative UI patterns with iOS 26 APIs
- **Structured Concurrency** - Modern async/await patterns with actor isolation
- **Performance Optimized** - Off-thread image loading with NSCache integration
- **Clean Architecture** - MVVM pattern with clear separation of concerns
- **Modular Components** - Reusable UI components with consistent styling
- **Dark Mode Support** - Fully adaptive interface with automatic theme detection

### üé® Design System
- **ESPN Brand Colors** - Authentic ESPN color palette with glass adaptations
- **Consistent Spacing** - 8pt grid system throughout the app
- **Accessibility** - VoiceOver support and dynamic type scaling
- **Responsive Layout** - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Animation System** - Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

## üéØ App Features & Navigation

### üè† Home Tab
- **News Feed** - Latest ESPN articles with glass card design
- **Breaking News** - Priority stories with prominent glass effects
- **Article Cards** - Smart image selection with 16:9 aspect ratios
- **Pull-to-Refresh** - Custom glass-styled refresh indicator
- **Infinite Scroll** - Smooth performance with background loading

### üèÜ Scores Tab
- **Live Scores** - Real-time game scores with live indicators
- **Multiple Sports** - NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAA coverage
- **Date Navigation** - Swipe between dates with glass transitions
- **Game Details** - Team logos, records, and game status
- **Score Updates** - Automatic refresh for live games

### üì∫ Watch Tab
- **Video Categories** - Organized content with different card layouts
- **Live Content** - Live streams with prominent "LIVE" indicators
- **Video Cards** - Multiple aspect ratios (16:9, 2:3, 4:3, 1:1)
- **Circle Cards** - League and sport logos with glass effects
- **Deep Linking** - Seamless ESPN app integration

### ESPN API Constraints
- **Rate Limiting** - API calls throttled during heavy usage
- **Video Authentication** - Most content requires ESPN+ subscription or TVE Authentication
- **Image Selection** - Occasional aspect ratio mismatches

## üõ† Technical Requirements

### Development Environment
- **Xcode-beta** (17.0+) with iOS 26 SDK
- **iOS 26.0+** target deployment
- **Swift 6.0** language features
- **SwiftUI** with latest iOS 26 APIs

### Device Support
- **Primary**: iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 26.0+) - Full glass effects
- **Secondary**: iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 26.0+) - Full glass effects  
- **Fallback**: iOS 18.0+ devices - Limited glass effects
- **Legacy**: iOS 17.0+ devices - Material effects only

### üöß **Work in Progress**
- **Advanced Glass Morphing** - Experimenting with complex shape transitions
- **Improved UX** - branching beyond the existing ESPN UX to experiment
